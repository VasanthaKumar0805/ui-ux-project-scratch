  <h3>3.Feedback</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Feedback is a crucial aspect of UI/UX design, as it helps users understand the results of their actions and
      builds trust in the system. Here are some key principles for designing effective feedback:
      <br>
      1. Timeliness: Provide feedback immediately after the user's action, while the action is still fresh in their
      mind.
      <br>
      2. Relevance: Ensure that the feedback is relevant to the user's action and goals.
      <br>
      3. Specificity: Provide specific and clear feedback that leaves no room for misinterpretation.
      <br>
      4. Consistency: Use consistent feedback patterns throughout the system to avoid confusing users.
      <br>
      5. Feedback types: Use different types of feedback, such as:
      - Visual feedback: Use colors, icons, and animations to provide feedback.
      - Auditory feedback: Use sounds to provide feedback.
      - Haptic feedback: Use vibrations or tactile sensations to provide feedback.
      <br>
      6. Feedback duration: Ensure that feedback is displayed for an adequate amount of time, but not so long that it
      becomes distracting.
      <br>
      7. Feedback placement: Place feedback in a location where it is easily noticeable, such as near the action that
      triggered it.
      <br>
      8. Error prevention: Design feedback to prevent errors from occurring in the first place, rather than just
      correcting them after they happen.
      <br>
      9. User control: Provide users with control over feedback, such as allowing them to dismiss or customize it.
      <br>
      10. Accessibility: Ensure that feedback is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

  <h3>4.Simplicity</h3>
  <p>Simplicity is the principle of creating intuitive interfaces that help users achieve their goals efficiently. It involves removing unnecessary elements and focusing on the essentials.</p>
  <center>
    <div class="para">
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Laboriosam aspernatur ad reiciendis! Fuga eius
        voluptate sit incidunt dolorum maxime ea dolores iure officiis, quo non inventore ipsa repudiandae deleniti vel!
      </p>
    </div>
  </center>
  <hr>
  <h3>5.Visibility</h3>
  <p>Visibility of system status <b> indicates that users should be continuously aware of what is going the system is
      doing or needing through feedback and display of information.</b> Visibility answers user questions as they
    interact with system interface, like: What is the current state of the system?</p>

        variety of abilities, backgrounds, and circumstances.</b> The goal is to create a user experience that is
      inclusive and welcoming for all, regardless of ability.</p>

    <p>Efficiency in user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design is <b>how quickly and easily users can complete
        tasks on a design. </b> It's a key aspect of a good UX and is measured by the number of clicks or keystrokes it
      takes a user to complete a task. </p>

      to do without making a mistake. </p>
